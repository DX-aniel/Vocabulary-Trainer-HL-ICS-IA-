# Vocabulary-Trainer-HL-ICS-IA-

An exploration of abstract data structures and an application of advanced OOP. 

The program uses a customly implemented hash map data structure to store and accesss data efficiently while it is running. Data retention is achieved by text and JSON files storing information like words, definitions, statistics, and account login details. Finally, the data is procured from the Oxford dictionary database using the Oxford API. Specifically, a list of 10,000 English words was used to retrieve the definition of each word from the Oxford database. These word and definition pairs were then stored onto a JSON file to be loaded into the program when it is run. This data is used in the form of interfaces inducive to vocabulary production. For example, there is a learning interface and a testing interface with multiple modes such as MC, T/F, and matching. The GUI was produced using the Java Swing library. 

The project is accompanied by many auxiliary resources used for planning and development. Flow charts, UML diagrams, and functionality lists were used prior to development. Interview with clients and advisors as well as documentation and comments were made during development. Finally, a demonstration video and prototype interviews were done after the completion of the project. All of the previously mentioned resources are presented on an HTML webpage. 

This is my M22 IB Higher Level ICS internal assessment (IA).
